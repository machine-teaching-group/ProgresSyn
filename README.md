This repository contains the code used for the paper our paper _"Synthesizing a Progression of Subtasks for Block-Based Visual Programming Tasks"_.

## Structure

A high level summary of project structure is as below:

- `code/`: Contains the source code for our algorithm and experiments presented in the paper.
- `data/`: The required input files and generated output files should/will be stored here.

Each directory has its own README file which should be referred for further details.

**Note:** All of the commands should be run from project root, i.e. from where this README located.
